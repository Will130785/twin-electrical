                            <p>“Needed a qualified electrician so looked on trust a trader and decided to try HS Electrical. Good choice. He came to do one job which he did promptly and efficiently then a week later we had a problem with our power ( totally unrelated). My husband phoned Harvey, who was out of the area but he came and put things right within a couple of hours, returning the following day with a replacement part so everything is now as good as new. Very efficient and approachable with a logical way of thinking. Comforting to have found a good electrician.”</p>
